# A-Rogue-like-Game-and-Leaderboard-A rogue-like game where players can submit scores to a leaderboard under a given username depending on their in-game performance. The game will have multiple playstyles to choose from, and will be playable on both keyboard/mouse and controllers. The game will feature multiple different enemy types in each level. It will feature procedural level generation so each player and level attempt has a unique experience. Our frontend will be the game application built in Godot. Our backend will be a web SQL server that the game sends requests to for the leaderboard. Our target platform is Windows 10/11 PCs. We will develop the game with an agile framework. Some other software that will be used for the development include Blender and Aseprite for creating graphical assets. 

# Software architecture:
# Frontend: Godot 4.3
# Backend: Python+SQLAlchemy
